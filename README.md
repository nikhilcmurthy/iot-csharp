C# Client Library - Introduction
============================================

This C# Client Library can be used to simplify interactions with the [IBM Watson IoT Platform] (https://internetofthings.ibmcloud.com). The documentation is divided into following sections:  

- The [Device section](docs/Device.rst) contains information on how devices publish events and handle commands using the C# IBMWIoTP Client Library.
- The [Managed Device section](docs/DeviceManagement.rst) contains information on how devices can connect to the Watson IoT Platform Device Management service using C# IBMWIoTP Client Library and perform device management operations like firmware update, location update, and diagnostics update.
- The [Gateway section](docs/Gateway.rst) contains information on how gateways publish events and handle commands for itself and for the attached devices using the C# IBMWIoTP Client Library.
- The [Gateway Management section](docs/GatewayManagement.rst) contains information on how to connect the gateway as Managed Gateway to IBM Watson IoT Platform and manage the attached devices.
- The [Application section](docs/Application.rst) details how applications can use the C# IBMWIoTP Client Library to interact with devices.
